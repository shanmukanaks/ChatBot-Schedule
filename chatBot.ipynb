What our model will do for us is it will label the statements the user is making and based on their statements the model will categorize it based on the tags we had implement in our intents json file. Based on what tag the model set the user input to be we can implement specific functionalities, such as, if the model determines that the user is trying to introduce themselves that would fall under the tag \"name\" and once we know that we can store the users name and greet them bye their name or address them by their name in later interactions. How we detect where the users name is in the statement they had inputed is by using something called spacy, spacy allows us to input a string to it and from that spacy is able to idetify what entities are in that string and if it identifies a person it will label that entity as a \"PERSON\" and we can find which word exactly is the users name and store that word. We can also use this when figuring out what day the user want to find their events for, if the user asks \"What do I have on Sunday\", \"Sunday will be classified as a \"DATE\" and by knowing this we can pass in this information to our get_events() function and figure out which events each user has on that date."
